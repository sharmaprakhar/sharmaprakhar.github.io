<p>
    Before I dive into the topic at hand, Please remember that this tutorial is going to be fairly technical. I advise the reader to read about DNS and
    associated systems for a better understanding of the tutorial. I, however, try to explain terms for easy readability as I go along the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    The Internet works in a complex way. The simple act of typing a URL (uniform resource locator) which takes you to a webpage has a lot going on in those
    seconds before the said page loads. An example URL or a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is the key text that you type out in the browser window that
    takes you to your website. You need to register that domain name before you can run a website on it. The registration is done under ICANN via numerous
    domain name registers available on the internet which register your domain name for a nominal price of $10 - $35 per year. The fee is deducted from your
    credit card or paypal account (which ever mode you choose or the registrar provides). To choose a domain name is tricky – you need the right name that
    describes your purpose on the internet and the desired top level domain, e.g. .com, .org, .net etc.
</p>
<p>
    The process of accessing a website via a link is fairly simple in theory. The website is stored on your web hosting server (which is essentially a machine
    running a software connected to the internet with a valid IP). Your website’s domain name is associated with this IP and Name Servers send queries to find
    said IP when you type in the domain name.
</p>
<p>
    A typical URL which looks like <a href="http://www.hosting.tutorial.com/root">www.hosting.tutorial.com/root</a> Consists of various components that
    essentially dictate what happens when you press enter in the browser window after typing in the URL. The www is the authoritative webserver, hosting is the
    sub-domain, tutorial the second level domain and com the top level domain. Each sub-domain can have (generally has) an associated name server that stores
    the database information of the link that you typed out. Name Servers send queries to other name servers present in other domains to locate the IP address
    of the computer on which the website or the domain name is located.
</p>
<p>
    I hope that made sense till now. If not, the purpose of this tutorial, which is to make you able to point your Web Hosting Name Servers to your domain name
    will still be fulfilled once you are through reading it so read on. From this point on I assume you have a registered domain name and have chosen a web
    hosting service.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Name Servers: </strong>
        These are also known as DNS servers. It’s the job of your web host’s name servers to convert your domain name into the location of your website (the IP
        address). To point your Name server to your domain name, first retrieve the name of name servers from the web host. There are generally two name
servers (NS1 and NS2) mentioned in the official documentation of your webhost (though there may be more like 3<sup>rd</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> and 5        <sup>th</sup>). The easiest way is to send an email query to your webhost and wait for their reply but you could also go through FAQs and the official
        documentation for the web host. Once you have the names of both (or more)of your name servers, note them down or save the email.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Domain Registrar:</strong>
        The next step is to log into your account created with the domain registrar while buying the domain and get to a page where they ask for name servers
        and type out (or copy paste) the names of the name servers to the text box where it is required and that is all there is to it. There are different
        ways to do it for different web hosts but a general overview is given below:<strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Look for a page that lets you edit the settings for your domains; “Domains manager” or “My Domains” might do the trick<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · “DNS menu” or “Name servers” edit page may be the pages that let you edit the settings of your name servers. There might be an auxiliary link that les
    you “set it” or “change it” or the “settings menu” for name servers<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Some Registrars let you work or change settings Domain by Domain. Get to the domain you want to make changes and then look for a link that hints at
    settings of the name servers.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once you are at the form that lets you edit the settings, write the names of the Name Servers in the appropriate boxes named ‘Primary Server’ or ‘Secondary
    Server’. There may be more and if your web host doesn’t provide them, leave them blank.
</p>
<p>
    In the whole process, doubts are bound to arise for a beginner. The best way to get them cleared is to read the documentation or FAQ section as users keep
    having problems all the time. If you are completely clueless, write to the Registrar of your Domain and ask for help but I suggest you go through the
    documentation and material once thoroughly in case you are stuck because more often than not, they reply point to the relevant documentation available.
