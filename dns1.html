<p>
    Whether you are an individual looking to put your thoughts and experiences on the internet through an independent blog or an organization looking to expand
    business online, one of the first decision among a series of decisions that you will have to make would be to choose an appropriate web host to serve your
    content on the internet. This is a comprehensive guide that will help you choose a web hosting service that fits your need and pocket.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Web hosting and Internet hosting</strong>
</p>
<p>
While there are many different kinds of Internet hosting services that vary in design, hardware and software functionalities, the basic service provided    <strong> </strong>by any internet hosting service is to provide a server and storage space and an internet connection with a good upstream bandwidth. Web
    hosting is one of the subdivisions or types of Internet hosting service
</p>
<p>
    A web hosting service (still divided into many types of hosting depending on what the service provider includes in the package) is essentially a server
    running an operating system, allowing access to users who wish to view the pre-loaded webpages or multimedia content of a website on the server. In this
    tutorial I analyze the existing services out there and categorize their features into four main domains that user need to keep in mind while choosing a
    good web host. They are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirement
    </li>
    <li>
        Service
    </li>
    <li>
        Business mechanism
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical aspect
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Requirement: </strong>
    Probably the<strong> </strong>most important aspect of choosing a good web host<strong> </strong>is to know one’s requirements. If you are an individual
    who just wants to play around on a website or a small community with an aim to display the regular events’ news, then you can go for a web hosting service
    that would be relatively cheap and that provides a good price for small storage and low software functionality (e.g. PHP, java, ruby on rails)
</p>
<p>
    If you are a business organization that wants to expand its business online and required an SSL and Database management client, you might want to go for a
    relatively expensive and robust web hosting package with greater space and software support like mail forwarding and a content management system.
</p>
<p>
    Figuring out the requirement which agrees with your budget will let you eliminate some options and let you decide more effectively.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Service: </strong>
    One of the most important measures by which you judge a web host is the service that it claims to provide and judging by the reviews it got from the users
    that used the service. The following points should be kept in mind while choosing a web host:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Call/e-mail/chat support</strong>
        : choose a web host that addresses the problems of the customers immediately. Toll-free customer care numbers are a plus. The email query support
        should respond on a 24 or 48 hour basis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Flexibility in server types and supported languages</strong>
        : Generally web hosts with greater flexibility have a higher price but it would be a good idea to pay the price and ensure that your website
        development doesn’t hit a roadblock with changes and addition of features.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Effective communication about changes in the server</strong>
        : The web host, while making changes to the server, should be responsible enough to intimate the users about the same. A research on the reviews by
        current users would give a good insight.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Control Panel</strong>
        : What kind of control panel, e.g. Plesk or cPanel does the web host use. The control panel should be easy enough and user friendly if you are a
        beginner.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Website builder system</strong>
        : A web host that complies with your specific needs is a must. Most of the web hosts have their own website builder systems which let you design but
        many are proprietary – once designed, they should work on other servers too.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Uptime</strong>
        : A claim of a 100% uptime is a false one. Read reviews and ask users to ensure which web host stays up the best.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Business Mechanism/ Payment plans</strong>
    :
</p>
<p>
    · Whether the web hosting service follows monthly/quarterly/Annual payment method. Choose the one that suits your pocket.
</p>
<p>
    · Choose a web server that is the closest to your location. That makes hosting easy for both the server side and the client side. The laws that govern
    disputes are also common
</p>
<p>
    · Choose a web host that won’t crowd your webpages with advertisements in exchange for a low price package. A balance between low prices and saving the
    integrity of your webpages is a must.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Technical Aspect: </strong>
    There can be different technical requirements of two different websites. We have listed all the possible requirements under one banner so that whether you
    are an individual or a big e-commerce hub, you could make a decision about what package and features you want when you select a web host<strong> </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Web space:</strong>
        whether the web server of a particular package that you buy from a webhosting service provider cater to your storage needs. It’s always good to have a
        buffer of storage space in case the website needs expansion<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>FTP access: </strong>
Online website builders are great for beginners but a web server should have FTP access for a direct upload of your pages on the mainframe.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>File size and Database size restrictions: </strong>
        The web host should not have file size restrictions or multimedia restrictions. However, care should also be taken while deciding about how much memory
        you want. Some web hosts provide separate database and file memory spaces. Make sure you are not stuck in a situation where you have 25Gb of file space
        and 20 Mb of database space.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Operating software/Language support: </strong>
        This as loosely explained in the requirement section. A basic website is what a beginner might desire but a commercial website handling hundreds of
        connections per day might require a linux server running PHP or perl with a Secure Sockets Layer and shopping cart for payments, autoresponders, telnet
        and SSH. Make sure your web host is okay with running scripts (with or without permission can be worked out with the package terms). Operating software
        is also crucial to choosing – e.g. for ASP programs, you will have to opt for a windows server but for cheaper and robust and largely virus free
        service, choose Unix based Apache servers. Apache servers give incredible flexibility.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multiple domain/Subdomains:</strong>
        A web host might provide you with multiple domains/subdomains for some monthly or quarterly extra charge. This would let you control multiple domains
        via one account that you hold with the web host service. <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shared/VPS/Dedicated server: </strong>
For a commercial hub to know whether a virtual server or a dedicated server is good for its purpose if it decides not to go with a shared server        <strong> </strong>for reasons of speed and uptime can prove to be important in ensuring the proper working of a website. Research more on these aspects
        for a better understanding of these servers and make an informed decision. While deciding on a memory shared server, make sure that the size being
        shared agrees with your requirement.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>CPU throttling and CPU share size: </strong>
        Some web hosts promise a CPU share size of 5% and CPU burstable share as 15-20%. This could be a deadly feature as this may bring down your website if
        it maintains at the burstable speed for more than a certain threshold. If a web host has a reputation of being down more than an acceptable amount of
        time, you may want to avoid it.<strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A right balance of these four aspects should be enough for a buyer to come up with a satisfying web hosting service for one’s needs. Reading reviews and
    gathering information about the one you think would be right for you is essential to discover loop holes in its service. These points are not exhaustive by
    any means. Research and a fair assessment of one’s requirements is the key to choosing a good web host. <strong></strong>
