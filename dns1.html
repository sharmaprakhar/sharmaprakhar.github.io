									<h3 align="center">DNS AND HOW TO CHOOSE A WEB HOST</h3></br>
									<!-- WRITE YOUR POST HERE-->
									How to choose a web host</br>
									</br>Whether you are an individual looking to put your thoughts and experiences on the internet through an independent blog or an organization looking to expand business online, one of the first decision among a series of decisions that you will have to make would be to choose an appropriate web host to serve your content on the internet. This is a comprehensive guide that will help you choose a web hosting service that fits your need and pocket.</br>
									</br>Web hosting and Internet hosting</br>
									</br>While there are many different kinds of Internet hosting services that vary in design, hardware and software functionalities, the basic service provided by any internet hosting service is to provide a server and storage space and an internet connection with a good upstream bandwidth. Web hosting is one of the subdivisions or types of Internet hosting service</br>
									
									</br>A web hosting service (still divided into many types of hosting depending on what the service provider includes in the package) is essentially a server running an operating system, allowing access to users who wish to view the pre-loaded webpages or multimedia content of a website on the server. In this tutorial I analyze the existing services out there and categorize their features into four main domains that user need to keep in mind while choosing a good web host. They are:</br>
									</br>
									<li>Requirement</li>
									<li>Service</li>
									<li>Business mechanism</li>
									<li>Technical aspect</li></br>
									</br>Requirement: Probably the most important aspect of choosing a good web host is to know one’s requirements. If you are an individual who just wants to play around on a website or a small community with an aim to display the regular events’ news, then you can go for a web hosting service that would be relatively cheap and that provides a good price for small storage and low software functionality (e.g. PHP, java, ruby on rails)</br>
									
									</br>If you are a business organization that wants to expand its business online and required an SSL and Database management client, you might want to go for a relatively expensive and robust web hosting package with greater space and software support like mail forwarding and a content management system.
									Figuring out the requirement which agrees with your budget will let you eliminate some options and let you decide more effectively.</br>
									</br>Service: One of the most important measures by which you judge a web host is the service that it claims to provide and judging by the reviews it got from the users that used the service. The following points should be kept in mind while choosing a web host:</br>
									<li> 	Call/e-mail/chat support: choose a web host that addresses the problems of the customers immediately. Toll-free customer care numbers are a plus. The email query support should respond on a 24 or 48 hour basis.</li>
									<li>Service</li>
									<li>Business mechanism</li>
									<li>Technical aspect</li></br>
